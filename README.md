# Starbuck Application Using Kotlin

This is my attempt at creating a custom design for a Starbucks application using Android Studio Kotlin. In this project, I focused primarily on the frontend and familiarizing myself with the available elements in Kotlin. The project consists of three main parts, each with its own function:
- OnBoarding Screen
- Login & Signup Screen
- Home Screen

All the resources for this project are available, including the source code in the Android Studio Kotlin project template, the design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/aKgU6vWej1HCwDskm2ekci/EAS-PPB?node-id=7033-352&t=T7rB8YSomZKVmtSs-1), and a video explanation on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ApVWVRw11HU?si=KXIetybhQ2xXdGTT)

<br>OnBoarding Screen introduces the app with a welcoming message and logo. 

### Login and Signup Screen

<br>Login and Signup Screen, allow users to create an account or log in. It features input fields for user data.  

### Home Screen

<br>Home Screen displays the userâ€™s reward points and offers a rewards system, collecting rewards will increases the points and redeeming items will decreases the points.
